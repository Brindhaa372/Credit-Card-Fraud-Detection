# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Built a supervised machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world datasets.
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression and data analysis techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used is from [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository or open the notebook directly in Google Colab and copy the code given in this link:
   [code](https://github.com/Brindhaa372/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb)
2. Upload the dataset (`creditcard.csv`)
3. Run each cell in sequence

## Features
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation using Logistic Regression
- Accuracy and classification metrics

### Output 
The model accurately detects fraudulent transactions based on user spending patterns and transaction data.

## Status
Complete â€“ ready to be reused or extended.
